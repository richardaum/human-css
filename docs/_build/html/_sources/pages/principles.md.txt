## Micro-attributes

Human CSS is a collection of micro-attributes: HTML attributes with very particular meaning.
These attributes are assigned to HTML elements,
which in this approach may have two or five or even ten attributes.
**We are moving the styling logic back into the HTML!**
The styling in the HTML becomes semnatic and readable.
Instead of having a class "book-list-entry" which contains 20 properties over in some distant CSS file,
we add three or four attributes to HTML which clearly express the styling of the entry.
In the best case, which is readily realizable in practice, no element-specific class is necessary at all.

## Combining micro-attributes

Human CSS uses a relatively limited number of general-purpose micro-attributes.
So `green` means green for text, or borders, or backgrounds.
But what if I want to specify both text color **and** border color on an element?
How do I know which color is which?
Other micro-class frameworks solve this by a proliferation of classes such as `green-border`, and `green-text`.
We take a different approach, which is to place the attributes on individual, nested HTML elements:

```html
<div one em margin>
  <div thick dark blue border>
    <div x-light pink background>
<div five percent padding>
        <div large bold white text>
          Bob
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Although this does result in more deeply nested HTML,
it also has major advantages.
Each element has a single, well-defined purpose,
and as mentioned above we need only generic attributes such as `blue` which work everywhere.
