Getting started
=====

First, install the library.

```sh
$ npm install @rtm/human-css
```

Then import it into your project's CSS, for example:

```css
    @import "human-css";
```

or

```css
    @import "~human-css";
```

You may now start using human CSS micro-attributes in your HTML:

```html
<div border="thick dark red color">
```
